# Current Working Functionality

# Site Wide:
- Fully responsive navbar with 3 links. 
- Search form successfully queries the blog posts for keywords and returns the results ordered by most recent first.
- Fully responsive dummy footer replete with social media & 3 sets of other dummy links.
- Fully responsive navbar with conditional navigation: 
  - If a user is logged in they see a link to "home", another to their dashboard and one to 'logout'.
  - If a user is not logged in, they see 3 links: "Home", "Register" & "Login".

## Landing Page Features:
- A header and page intro with content hinting.
- The full list of blog articles sorted by date (most recent first).
- Each article "card" links to the actual article page.
- Article thumbnails are responsive & look good on all screens.

## Blog Article Page Features:
- A header with a rotating health-related inspirational quote.
- The blog post itself including: Title, author, author's photo, post photo, date published and content. All 
  laid out in a clean minimalist design in keeping with the tone of the site.
- The add comment form sits above the comments themselves for good UX.
- Comments are displayed in a single column, most recent listed first.
- Adding comments is fully functional.
- Replying & deleting comments is not functional.
- If a user is logged in, their username is auto-populated in the "Name" input field of the "Add a New Comment" form.

## User Dashboard Features
- This page is not fleshed out. Its' purpose is to serve as proof of concept for the registration & login features.
- Theoretically I was thinking of attaching a "save post" button to each individual blog article and links to those articles 
would appear listed on the dashboard, which when clicked, would redirect to the post details page.

## Back-End
- The index page fetches blog listings successfully from the JSON-Server API.
- The blog post page fetches a single blog post from the JSON-SERVER API.
- The add comment form fetches a POST request from the JSON-SERVER API.
- The site is connected successfully to MongoDB 
- Users can register an account, their details are stored in MongoDB via Mongoose and their password is salted & hashed
  using Bcrypt. 
- User data is validated first by Bootstrap Forms, then by Joi, then by custom validations.
- Users are authenticated using Passport.js

## SEO
- Meta tags are incorporated into all pages. Most importantly: geo, keywords & description.
- All pages have relevant "keyworded" title tags.
- The blog details page uses keyword-rich "slugs" instead of ids.
- All links are functional.
- (Hypothetically) - All headings match keyword research & strategies.

## Accessibility
- All elements are keyboard accessible. 
- Skip to Main Link functional on all pages for good keyboard user UX & accessibility.
- Contrast, sizing & colour accessibility is all excellent.
- Colour-blind accessible - checked using the web disability simulator Chrome plugin.
- Site is viewable & functional up to page zoom of 200%.
- All forms have ariaDescribedBy attributes.
- Wherever possible and logical, HTML elements are semantic. Posts are ```<articles>``` etc..
- All photos have alt tags.

<br>

# Future Potential Functionality
- Pagination of the index page blog listings.
- Perhaps making it so that only logged-in users can comment.
- Allowing users to delete and edit their own comments.
- Making the "reply" on comments functional.
- Creating an admin login.
- Allowing admins to create new blog posts.
- Allowing admins to edit & delete blog posts.
